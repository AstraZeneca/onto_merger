    <b>OntoMerger</b> is an ontology alignment library for deduplicating knowledge graph nodes,
    (i.e. ontology concepts) that represent the same domain, e.g. diseases, and connecting
    them to form a single directed acyclic hierarchical graph (DAG) (i.e. an ontology class
    hierarchy). For more details about OntoMerger,
    please <a href="https://ontomerger.readthedocs.io/">read the docs</a>.</p>
