<p>The output consists of four tables:
    <ul>
        <li><code>nodes.csv</code>: contains the final set of nodes (i.e. canonical nodes),
            excluding merged nodes.</li>
        <li><code>merges.csv</code>: contains the aligned and the corresponding canonical node IDs;
            this set is the difference between the input and output nodes.</li>
        <li><code>mappings.csv</code>: node IDs are potentially updated with canonical node IDs
            and/or internal code reassignments</li>
        <li><code>edges_hierarchy.csv</code>: contains the merged ontology hierarchy.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>All output tables are profiled and validated, these details are presented in the
    <a href="#Data Profiling">Data Profiling</a> and <a href="#Data Tests">Data Tests</a>
    sections, respectively. For more details about the output data,
