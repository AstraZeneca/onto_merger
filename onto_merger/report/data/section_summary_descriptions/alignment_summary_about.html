<p>The alignment process takes available mappings and produces a
    set of stable merges (<code>output/domain_ontology/merges.csv</code>).
    The goal is to have the minimal number of nodes, from the minimal number of different
    sources (ontologies).
</p>
<p>
    The alignment process is a sequence of steps,
    where in each step we attempt to merge nodes to a given ontology.
    This alignment order is produced by putting the <b>seed ontology</b> as first
    (this should have the most mappings and the desired hierarchy), and the rest of the
    ontologies according to the frequency of the nodes.</p>
<p>
    First we use the strongest mapping relation
    type group, equivalence, then database reference and the rest.
