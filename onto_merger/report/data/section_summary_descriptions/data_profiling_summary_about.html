               target="_blank">Pandas profiling</a> is a tool for exploring
    data: it creates HTML profiling reports from <code>pandas DataFrame</code> objects.
    OntoMerger generates profiling reports for each input and output tables.
    Analysing these reports can provide insights (e.g. what are the missing mappings, and/or hierarchies)
    for fine tuning the inputs in order to further reduce duplication and to increase connectivity.
    For more details about how we use data profiling,
    please <a href="https://ontomerger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/analysis.html"> read the docs</a>.
